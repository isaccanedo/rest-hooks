title: Rest Hooks 4.1 Released
authors: [ntucker]
tags: [releases, rest-hooks]
---

4.1 comes with a more granular data definition hierarchy that will make it easier to
write more API definitions. This marked by the introduction of a new member known
as [Entity](/docs/4.1/api/Entity). `Entity` only needs a `pk()` and `get key()`, as well
as member declarations to integrate fully.

### Entity

- Useful for nested entities that don't have endpoints like LatestPrice.
- Useful for non-REST style APIs like GraphQL.
- Simplifies defining nested entities.

### New hierarchy:

```
 SimpleRecord
      |
   Entity
      |
SimpleResource
      |
   Resource
```

### Deprecations:

- Resource.getKey() -> Resource.key
- Resource.getEntitySchema() -> Resource.asSchema()
- Entity.define() -> override Entity.schema

### Changes:

- Normalizr: top level key sent to getId is undefined not null
- pk() now takes additional parent, and key optional args
- pk() no longer accepts number return value (run .toString())
