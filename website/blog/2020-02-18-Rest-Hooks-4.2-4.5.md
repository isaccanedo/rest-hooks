A lot of exciting features have been developed recently, resulting in many feature releases.
We've been hard a work integrating them into Coinbase's various products, so I skipped a few
release announcements. The biggest focus has been performance features - highlighted by
adding true [optimistic updates](https://resthooks.io/docs/4.5/guides/optimistic-updates).

Internal Breaking:
Changing middlewares results in a new dispatch that properly wraps those middlewares. Technically this is
a fix, but if you relied on the old behavior be careful!
