## New Features

### Reduced bundle size with custom networking library

Resource comes with a default `fetch()` implementation to make getting started easy.
It uses [superagent](http://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/) as the networking library
due to its server-side support as well as nice interface via the [builder pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern).
However, this comes at the cost of 6kb gziped added to the bundle. For those who want
to [use another networking library](https://resthooks.io/docs/2.2/guides/custom-networking) this is quite a cost to pay for a library that itself
is well under 10kb gzip.

To solve this problem there is a new exported called `SimpleResource`. This provides
all the Resource behavior without the `fetch()` implementation. If you're customizing
`fetch()` or want to customize `fetch()`, simply [follow the instructions](https://resthooks.io/docs/2.2/guides/custom-networking) to use
SimpleResource as your base class now. With tree-shaking this will leave [superagent](http://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/)
out of your bundle and save a cool 6kb gzip.

### RPCAction, PurgeAction

RPCAction, PurgeAction types join ReceiveAction and FetchAction as exportes from Rest Hooks.
Internally Rest Hooks dispatches actions (plain objects) that describe what Rest Hooks should do.
The structure of these actions is typed and previously only some of those types were actually
exported. Now you can get access to all of them. This is most useful for building your own [custom
managers](https://resthooks.io/docs/2.2/api/Manager).

## Improved Debugging

Sometimes the backend can fail and return bad responses - even without an HTTP error code.
It would behoove any fetching library to gracefully handle those cases and inform the user what
happened.

Previously there was a check for this very case - but it was only included in development mode.
Having certain bug checking code only exist in development mode makes sense for errors that
would exist and be caught in the client code. However, for issues independant of client (like
servers) this is an unreasonable restriction.

To solve this, the default `fetch()` implementation in `Resource` has been updated to
check for valid responses even in production. Its checking logic has also been improved.
Additionally the internal action dispatching types have been updated to not allow void
responses for anything besides a PurgeAction. This is important to enforce voids are not
passed around as they have no meaning as the result of a fetch. This leads the way to [further
type refinements that enforce this as the FetchShape.fetch()](https://github.com/coinbase/rest-hooks/issues/120)
level as to ensure user implementations provide those same guarantees.

Now even in production - if the API soft errors by returning an invalid response without
an error status code you will get a "JSON expected but not returned from API" error response.

## Type refinements

`String` is considered a valid payload to be sent in requests, so it has been added to the union along
with `object`. This makes API really as flexible as it should be.
