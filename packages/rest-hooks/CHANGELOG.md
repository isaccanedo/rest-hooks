## 5.0.0 (2021-01-19)

### ⚠ 💥 BREAKING CHANGES

* Node engine requirement of >=0.12
* getFetchOptions() -> getEndpointExtra()
* - Removed Resource.fetchOptionsPlugin()
- Added Resource.getFetchInit() which is called in shape generators
- Resourece.fetch() interface changed to match browser fetch()
* - denormalize has third boolean value to track deletion
- deletes no long remove entities, but replace them with DELETE symbol (exported from normalizr)
- schema of delete shape should be the `new schemas.Delete()`
- useInvalidator()'s function calls will always suspend - even without invalidIfStale
- deleted entities that are required by a useResource() will now cause it to suspend rather than throwing `404`
- required entities missing from network response will now throw error in useResource() just like other unexpected deserializations
- FetchShape type is now just 'read' | 'mutate'. No more 'delete'. (use schema.Delete())
* Resource.getEntitySchema() removed, use Resource
directly
* Resource getKey() deleted. Use `get key()`
* Action creator arguments changed
Mutates produce the same action type as 'read's
* Mutation fetches now result in:
- meta entries
- results entries
* url -> key on all action.meta
Testing lib now relies on new export in rest-hooks 5
* Added promise to FetchAction['meta']
* When invalidIfStale is true, useCache() and
useStatefulResource() will no longer return entities, even if they
are in the cache
* * url() and listUrl() params are no longer optional
* Removed resolveFetchData() in favor of fetchResponse().
  * fetch() now calls fetchResponse()
  * This means custom use of Response can be achieved by calling
fetchResponse() in custom FetchShape.fetch
* Remove generic signatures to any Resource.fetch()
overrides
* * fetchPlugin -> fetchOptionsPlugin, which has different signature
* No more SuperagentResource export
* New overridable Resource.resolveFetchData()
* rest-hooks/test -> @rest-hooks/test
