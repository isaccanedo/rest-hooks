## 1.0.0 (2021-01-19)

### ⚠ 💥 BREAKING CHANGES

* Remove `normalize`, `denormalize`; use
`normalizr` package for those
* Resources will resolve with any nested
entities from their schemas, rather than the `pk` of those
entities
* useResource() inferred endpoint will sometimes
not trigger a fetch if entities are fresh enough
* Node engine requirement of >=0.12
* getFetchOptions() -> getEndpointExtra()
* - Removed Resource.fetchOptionsPlugin()
- Added Resource.getFetchInit() which is called in shape generators
- Resourece.fetch() interface changed to match browser fetch()
* - denormalize has third boolean value to track deletion
- deletes no long remove entities, but replace them with DELETE symbol (exported from normalizr)
- schema of delete shape should be the `new schemas.Delete()`
- useInvalidator()'s function calls will always suspend - even without invalidIfStale
- deleted entities that are required by a useResource() will now cause it to suspend rather than throwing `404`
- required entities missing from network response will now throw error in useResource() just like other unexpected deserializations
- FetchShape type is now just 'read' | 'mutate'. No more 'delete'. (use schema.Delete())

- deleted entities that are required by a useResource() will now cause it to suspend rather than throwing `404`
- required entities missing from network response will now throw error in useResource() just like other unexpected deserializations
- FetchShape type is now just 'read' | 'mutate'. No more 'delete'. (use schema.Delete())
* - Removed Resource.fetchOptionsPlugin()
- Added Resource.getFetchInit() which is called in shape generators
- Resourece.fetch() interface changed to match browser fetch()
