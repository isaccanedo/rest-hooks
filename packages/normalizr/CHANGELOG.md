### ‚ö† üí• BREAKING CHANGES

not trigger a fetch if entities are fresh enough
* Node engine requirement of >=0.12
* - denormalize has third boolean value to track deletion
- deletes no long remove entities, but replace them with DELETE symbol (exported from normalizr)
- schema of delete shape should be the `new schemas.Delete()`
- useInvalidator()'s function calls will always suspend - even without invalidIfStale
- deleted entities that are required by a useResource() will now cause it to suspend rather than throwing `404`
- required entities missing from network response will now throw error in useResource() just like other unexpected deserializations
- FetchShape type is now just 'read' | 'mutate'. No more 'delete'. (use schema.Delete())

recursion.

### BREAKING CHANGE

* Node engine requirement of >=0.12
* useResource() inferred endpoint will sometimes
not trigger a fetch if entities are fresh enough

## 6.0.0-k.0 (2021-01-06)

* pkg: Use @babel/runtime @ 7.12 ([e631f6a](https://github.com/coinbase/rest-hooks/commit/e631f6a))

### BREAKING CHANGE

* - denormalize has third boolean value to track deletion
- deletes no long remove entities, but replace them with DELETE symbol (exported from normalizr)
- schema of delete shape should be the `new schemas.Delete()`
- useInvalidator()'s function calls will always suspend - even without invalidIfStale
- deleted entities that are required by a useResource() will now cause it to suspend rather than throwing `404`
- required entities missing from network response will now throw error in useResource() just like other unexpected deserializations
- FetchShape type is now just 'read' | 'mutate'. No more 'delete'. (use schema.Delete())
