- No nested exports - only allowed usage:
  - `import { /* something */ } from '@rest-hooks/test';`
  - `import packageJson from '@rest-hooks/test/package.json';`

### 💅 Enhancement

* Define package exports for modern tooling ([#590](https://github.com/coinbase/rest-hooks/issues/590)) ([5a3e00b](https://github.com/coinbase/rest-hooks/commit/5a3e00b26451c6d0a480925f5f1ab7099a7aedeb))

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/coinbase/rest-hooks/compare/@rest-hooks/test@2.0.1...@rest-hooks/test@3.0.0) (2021-01-31)

### ⚠ 💥 BREAKING CHANGES

* - result.current, result.error is now `undefined` after suspense, rather than `null`
-  interval will now default to 50ms in async utils
-  timeout will now default to 1000ms in async utils
-  suppressErrors has been removed from async utils
- Adjust types so that react renderer exports don't required extra generic parameter
- Importing from renderHook and act from @testing-library/react-hooks will now auto-detect which renderer to used based on the project's dependencies
    - peerDependencies are now optional to support different dependencies being required
    - This means there will be no warning if the dependency is not installed at all, but it will still warn if an incompatible version is installed
    - Auto-detection won't work with bundlers (e.g. Webpack). Please use as specific renderer import instead
